	      <p>Please contact your university's authorities for concerns that need to be addressed at a higher level.</p>

		<li>dismissal from the nucleus</li>

	      </ul>
	      <p>This code of conduct was adapted from the <a href="https://www.coolworldslab.com/philosophy">Cool Worlds Lab group's code</a> which in turn was adapted from <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/corrales-research-group/code-of-conduct?fref=gc">Dr Lia Corrales group's</a>, which, in turn, was adapted from the <a href="https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/docs/meta.html">Data Exploration Lab's code</a>. We also borrowed some ideas from the Deep Sky Lab Terms of Collaboration (private communication). </p>
