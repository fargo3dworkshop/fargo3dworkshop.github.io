	    <div class="content">
	      <p>By participating in the FARGO3D workshop, all participants agree to the following code of conduct. </p>

	      <p>The workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free, safe environment for everyone, regardless of race, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, politics and appearance. Harassment of other participants is not tolerated in any form.</p>

	      <p> Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination</li>
		<li>Sexual imagery or language</li>
		<li>Racially charged language or jokes</li>
		<li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
		<li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
		<li>Unwelcome attention, including photography and recording</li>
		<li>Sustained disruption of talks (e.g. interrupting or talking over another person to an unnecessary degree)</li>
		<li>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above</li>
	      </ul>

	      <p>Workshop participants are expected to adhere to the code of conduct during all activities, including coffee breaks and lunch.</p>

	      <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact directly a member of the local organizing committee (LOC). All reports will be confidential. All reported cases will be taken seriously. </p>

	      <p>Please contact your university's authorities for concerns that need to be addressed at a higher level.</p>

	      <p>A variety of steps can be taken by those responsible for the investigation. Subject to appropriateness and relevance, these may include:</p>

	      <ul>
		<li>verbal warning and a chance to remedy their behavior,</li>
		<li>formal written warning,</li>
		<li>dismissal from the workshop</li>
		<li>filing a criminal complaint.</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>This code of conduct was adapted from the <a href="https://www.coolworldslab.com/philosophy">Cool Worlds Lab group's code</a> which in turn was adapted from <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/corrales-research-group/code-of-conduct?fref=gc">Dr Lia Corrales group's</a>, which, in turn, was adapted from the <a href="https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/docs/meta.html">Data Exploration Lab's code</a>. We also borrowed some ideas from the Deep Sky Lab Terms of Collaboration (private communication). </p>
